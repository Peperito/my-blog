# Get started with Android developement

## Before you get started

There are several ways to build your phone application for a project. The first thing I could recommend anyone, is to give a quick try to the different alternatives. React Native, Flutter, etc...
Get started with youtube tutorials and docs, build a very simple app and see what fits your requirements.

### Full beginner tutorials

Here is my selection of youtube tutorials for absolute beginners in their journey with Android Developement

#### Learn Kotlin Basics and build your first Project

**[9 hours class to cover the basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwoxgUPabMk&ab_channel=tutorialsEU)**

**[Get started with Jetpack compose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDabx3SjuOY&list=PLQkwcJG4YTCSpJ2NLhDTHhi6XBNfk9WiC&ab_channel=PhilippLackner)**

**I can only recommend subscribing to Phillip channels, he also covers many more advanced topcs**

Once you're done with those 2 tutorials and are comfortable with the basics, don't hesitate to build your own first project.

#### Consolidate the knowledge

Now that your knowledge of the basics is fairly solid, it's time to... Revisit them.
Before moving to more advanced topics, carefully reading Kotlin docs and Android Developer Docs is a must.

**[Kotlin Doc](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html)** <br/>
**[Android Developer](https://developer.android.com/guide)** <br/>

Finally, if you want to test yourself on the topics you learned so far, create a profile on **[Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/)**

Checkout the the Android Development with Kotlin course, get your 13 badges

With all this, you built yourself a strong base to explore Kotlin and Android Dev.
